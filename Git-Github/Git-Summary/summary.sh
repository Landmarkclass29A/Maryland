Coveth the blessings:

Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy
kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee

And I will make of thee a great nation,and I will bless thee, and make thy
name great; and thou shalt be a blessing

And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee
and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
