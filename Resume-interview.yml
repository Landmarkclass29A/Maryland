What is difference b/w monitoring and observability ?
What is Observability and why does it matter?

Observability is the extent to which the internal states of a system can be 
inferred from externally available data. An observable software system provides 
the ability to understand any issue that arises. Conventionally, the three 
pillars of observability data are metrics, logs and traces. 
Dynatrace extends this with UX and topology information. 
However, turning data into answers requires more than just an observable system.

Monitoring is based on gathering predefined sets of metrics or logs.
Observability is tooling or a technical solution that allows 
teams to actively debug their system. Observability is 
based on exploring properties and patterns not defined in advance.
